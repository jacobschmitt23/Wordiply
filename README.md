# Wordiply
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This project implements Wordiply, an interactive word game where suers guess words containing a given starter word. The program validates command-lin arguments, processes a dictionary file, and ensures guesses meet criteria such as containing the starter word, being unique, and existing in the dictionary. The program calculates and displays results like the total length of guessed words and the longest words guessed or possible. Demonstrating expertise in C programming, it features dynamic memory management, efficient text processing, robust error handling, and interactive CLI design.</li>
