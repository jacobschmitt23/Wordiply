# Wordiply
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This project implements Wordiply, an interactive word game where users guess words containing a given starter word. The program validates command-lin arguments, processes a dictionary file, and ensures guesses meet criteria such as containing the starter word, being unique, and existing in the dictionary. The program calculates and displays results like the total length of guessed words and the longest words guessed or possible. Demonstrating expertise in C programming, it features dynamic memory management, efficient text processing, robust error handling, and interactive CLI design.</li>
    <li>The program was developed as part of a university course and relies on custom header files and file pathways specifc to the course's development environment. Due to these dependencies, the project will not compile or run successfully outside the context of the course's environment.</li>
